# Overview

Coding interviews are a good tool to assess an engineer's ability to solve problems. The main requirements for even trying to attempt a coding interview question are:

- Foundations of programming ( you must have an understanding of programming )
- [Understand Memory](/understanding%20memory/README.md)
- [Data Structures](/data%20structures/README.md)
- [Complexity Analysis](/Big%20O%20notation/README.md)
- [Algorithms](/algorithms/README.md)
- [How to solve problems](/how%20to%20solve%20problems/README.md)

Data structures are basically a way to store data. There are what you are required to understand so that you can know how they work and the best scenarios to use one over the other.

The basic ones that you are required to learn include:

- [Arrays](/data%20structures/arrays/README.md)
- [Strings](/data%20structures/strings/README.md)
- [Linked Lists](/data%20structures/linked%20lists/README.md)
- [Stacks and Queues](/data%20structures/stacks%20and%20queues/README.md)
- [Hash Tables](/data%20structures/hash%20tables/README.md)
- [Graphs](/data%20structures/graphs/README/.md)
- [Tries](/data%20structures/trees/README.md)

Complexity analysis goes hand in hand with data structures becaue it is the knowledge required to further understand data structures and how to work with them. This is the bedrock of coding interview problems.

Algorithms are another side of learning how to use data structures with the proper understanding of complexity analysis in order to solve coding problems. Simply put, Algorithms are just steps of solving a particular problem. It is the instructions you give to a computer on how to go about solving a particular problem.

In computer science, there are a myriad of these and they all have different use cases. And . . . you can also write your own if your feel some of the ones known by the community are a little slow for you. They include algorithms like:

- Binary Search
- kadane's Algorithm
- A\* Algorithm

. . . and many more.
