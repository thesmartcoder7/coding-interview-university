# Factorial O ( n! )
Ok, I am just going to flat out say this. This is not a complexty you'd often encounter. If by any chance your code runs with this complexity, you are definitely doing something wrong. This is because it is the steepest and most expensive of them all.

With Factorial complexity, if basically means that you are adding a nested loop for every single input you have.
