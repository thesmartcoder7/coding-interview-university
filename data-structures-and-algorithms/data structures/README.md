# Introduction to Data Structures

This is the one thing that really scares a lot of developers. The thing is, Data structures are just different ways of storing data. These really help with efficiency for arranging and accessing data ( read and write . . . ). Can be overwhelming but they are what computer scientists refer to as the fundamentals of computer science.

It is also good to understand that these da ta structures exsist because a "one size fits all" kind of data structure doesn't exist. This means that they all work differently, and one can be better than the other when it comes to a specif problem.

There are two parts to understanding these data structures:

- How to build them
- How to use them

The common data structures used are:
- [Arrays](/data%20structures/arrays/README.md)
- [Strings](/data%20structures/strings/README.md)
- [Linked Lists](/data%20structures/linked%20lists/README.md)
- [Stacks and Queues](/data%20structures/stacks%20and%20queues/README.md)
- [Hash Tables](/data%20structures/hash%20tables/README.md)
- [Graphs](/data%20structures/graphs/README/.md)
- [Tries](/data%20structures/trees/README.md)

Many as they come, data structures have basic operations that can be performed on them for which the complexities are different. These operations are include:
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Update / Edit
- Traversal
- Access / Read 
- Search
- Sorting

Selecting one to use for solving your problem comes down to the sacrifices you are willing to make. Whether you want to sacrifice time or space.
